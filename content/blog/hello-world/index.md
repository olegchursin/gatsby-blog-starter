Details
**THIS IS A VIRTUAL EVENT via Zoom co-hosted by Nicholas Feitel and Oleg Chursin**

So you've built a website (have you considered Gatsby?) but how will the world see it? And how secure is it? Are you enforcing HTTPS? Do you want to allow others to wrap your site in an iframe on theirs? How do you want the browsers to interpret your files?

Oleg Chursin, a SD/SE at Aon and the co-founder of the GatsbyNYC meetup will explore with us a simple way to make your web projects both accessible and secure by implementing Browser security headers (with Netlify hosting).

Any experience with Github and either HTML5, JS, Ruby, Python, Elixir or PHP and their web frameworks (Express, Rails, Django, Flask, Phoenix, etc.) might be helpful as a background for attending.

A sample Github repo will be provided but also feel free to bring a web project on Github you've been meaning to deploy and we'll get it on the internet and secure!
